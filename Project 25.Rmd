## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1a. Store the 100,000 pieces of data that you scraped in Project 24 into a data frame.

myDF <- data.frame(mytitlefunc(sprintf("%07d", 000001:100000)))
#1b. Save that data frame in  an xlsx file, for instance, using the write.xlsx function from the library "xlsx"
install.packages("xlsx")
library(xlsx)
write.xlsx(myDF, file="myworkbook.xlsx", sheetName="Movies")
#2a.  Find the name of the director of the first movie from this website.
xpathSApply(htmlParse(getURL("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt000001/")), "//*/meta[@name='director']", xmlGetAttr, "content")
#2b.  Find the names of the actors from the first movie mentioned on this website.
xpathSApply(htmlParse(getURL("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt000001/")), "//*/meta[@name='actors']", xmlGetAttr, "content")
#2c.  Find the name of the first movie mentioned on this website.
xpathSApply(htmlParse(getURL("https://www.imdb.com/title/tt000001/")), "//*/meta[@name='title']", xmlGetAttr, "content")
#3a-c. Answer the 3 questions above by making 3 visualiations from the data assembled.
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = director) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = movie, y = director))
ggplot(data = actors) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = movie, y = actors))
ggplot(data = title) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = movie, y = title))
